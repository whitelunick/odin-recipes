    <h3>For Omelette</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>We'll make one omurice at a time. Whisk 1 egg and 1 tbsp
            milk in a small bowl
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in the pan over medium high heat</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, pour egg mixture into the pan. Titled to cover the
            bottom of the pan. Lower the heat when the bottom of the egg has set
        </li>
        <li>Put the tbsp cheese and half of the ketchup fried rice on top
            of the omelette.
        </li>
        <li>Use the spatula to fold both sides of omelette toward the middle
            to cover the fried rice. Slowly move the omurice to the edge of 
            the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Hold a plate in one hand and the pan in the other hand, flip the pan
            and move the omurice to the plate.
        </li>
        <li>While it's still hot, cover the omurice with a paper towel and shape it
            into a football shape. Repeat the process to make a second omurice. 
        </li>
    </ol>
