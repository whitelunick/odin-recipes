        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients and preheat oven to 400ÂºF</li>
            <li>Combino panko and oil in a frying pan and toast 
                over medium until golden brown. Transfer to bowl and cool.
            </li>
            <li>Cut onions into thin slices</li>
            <li>Remove the extra fat on the pork. </li>
            <li>Pound the meat, then mold the meat back into its original shape.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper onto meat. </li>
            <li>Dredge each pork piece in bowl of flour to coat completely. 
                Pat off the excess flour.
            </li>
            <li>Beat an egg in a bowl, and coat the pork with the egg. 
                Then coat the pork with the toasted panko. Press the
                pankop flakes on to make sure they adhere to the pork.
            </li>
            <li>Place the pork on a baking sheet, bake for 20 minutes or until
                the pork is no longer pink inside.

            <li>Put half the onion slices into an oyakudon pan, pour 1/2 cup of
                katsudon sauce to cover them. Bring the sauce and onions to a boil.
                Lower the meat to medium and cook until onion slices are translucent
                (4-5 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>Put tonktasu in pan, turn the heat to medium high. Pour a 
                beaten egg over tonkatsu evenly and cover with the lid.

            <li>Cook until the egg is half cooked, about 30 seconds, turn off
